# toy-json
This project only exists to play around with Rust enums and pattern matching. This is by no means intended to be used for any actual JSON validation (see any `FIXME`s in the comments), nor is it intended to be an example of good Rust, good lexing, etc.

## Issues and Contribution
I have no plans to maintain issues nor approve PRs, but you're welcome to attempt to persuade me otherwise. If you have any kind suggestions for improvements, I'm all ears.
